# CS 535: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

## Course Description
This course covers the design of efficient exact and approximation algorithms for a variety of problems, with mathematical proof of correctness and analyses of time and space requirements and approximation bounds. Topics include shortest paths with arbitrary lengths, negative circuits and minimum mean circuits, minimum spanning arborescence, bipartite matching, non-bipartite matching, min-cost T-joins, maximum flow, min-cost flow, circulation and transshipments, submodular functions and polymatroids, and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. Lectures and exercises also cover a wide range of practical applications.

## Objectives
Broadly, the course has three objectives:
- Learn how to abstract a real-world computational problem into a mathematically clean core.
- Identify the algorithm design techniques appropriate for the context, based on the structure of the problem.
- Mathematically analyze the algorithms, and quantify the relative merits of various design choices.

## Prerequisites
- CS 430

## Course Format and Grading
- Homework assignments on theoretical and practice problems
- Midterm and final exams
